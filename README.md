# Introduction-to-Digital-Image-Processing
Using Octave
Course that I'm doing on the college.
It's an introducting to Digital Image Processing by using Matlab, but I use linux and don't have money to pay Matlab, then I'm using GNU Octave that is full free.
To do class0 I don't install any package, and did it all using Octave version 4.0.0
To do class1 I  installed the image package, and did it all using Octave version 4.2.2
The image package can be donwloaded here: "https://octave.sourceforge.io/image/index.html"
